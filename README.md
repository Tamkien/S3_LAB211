These codes are mostly uncompleted, which means if you copy them, you fail. I can only give you the main ideas.

My lecturer was Mr.TuanVM, so it might be a bit harsher than your current situation.

The most completed files are S11 and S74. S11 is somewhat alright though there're quite a lot of logical problems. Also it lacks of comments and you must utilize BigInteger instead of Long for all the conversion. S74 is alright, there're some logical problems, like if user enters wrong matrix size, make him/her enter only that matrix again. My comments in S74 are OK.

Contact me for any question. If you want me to help you pass the course, I will but it costs.
